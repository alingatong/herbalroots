                    <h2 class="mb-3">About Stinging Nettle (Alingatong)</h2>

                    <p>
                      Stinging nettle <i>(Alingatong)</i> has been a staple in herbal medicine since ancient times.<br><br>
                      Ancient Egyptians used stinging nettle to treat arthritis and lower back pain, while Roman troops rubbed it on themselves to help stay warm<br><br>
                      Its scientific name, <i>Urtica dioica</i>, comes from the Latin word <i>uro</i>, which means “to burn,” because its leaves can cause a temporary burning sensation upon contact.<br><br>
                      The leaves have hair-like structures that sting and also produce itching, redness and swelling<br><br>
                      However, once it is processed into a supplement, dried, freeze-dried or cooked, stinging nettle can be safely consumed. Studies link it to a number of potential health benefits.<br><br>
                      Here are 6 evidence-based benefits of stinging nettle.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <p style="color: black; font-weight: bolder;">
                      1. Contains Many Nutrients
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Stinging nettle’s leaves and root provide a wide variety of nutrients, including:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="list-detail py-3">
                      <li><span>
                        Vitamins: Vitamins A, C
                        and K, as well as several B vitamins
                      </span></li>

                      <li><span>
                        Fats: Linoleic acid,
                        linolenic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid
                      </span></li>

                      <li><span>
                        Minerals: Calcium, iron,
                        magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and sodium
                      </span></li>

                      <li><span>
                        Amino acids: All of the essential amino acids
                      </span></li>

                      <li><span>
                        Polyphenols: Kaempferol,
                        quercetin, caffeic acid, coumarins and other flavonoids
                      </span></li>

                      <li><span>
                        Pigments: Beta-carotene, lutein,
                        uteoxanthin and other carotenoids
                      </span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      What’s more, many of these nutrients act as antioxidants inside your body.<br><br>
                      Antioxidants are molecules that help defend your cells against damage from free radicals. Damage caused by free radicals is linked to aging, as well as cancer and other harmful diseases.<br><br>
                      Studies indicate that stinging nettle extract can raise blood antioxidant levels
                    </p>

                      2. May Reduce Inflammation
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Inflammation is your body’s way of healing itself and fighting infections.<br><br>
                      However, chronic inflammation can inflict significant harm.<br><br>
                      Stinging nettle harbors a variety of compounds that may reduce inflammation.<br><br>
                      In animal and test-tube studies, stinging nettle reduced levels of multiple inflammatory hormones by interfering with their production.<br><br>
                      In human studies, applying a stinging nettle cream or consuming stinging nettle products appears to relieve inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis.<br><br>
                      For instance, in one 27-person study, applying a stinging nettle cream onto arthritis-affected areas significantly reduced pain, compared to a placebo treatment.<br><br>
                      In another study, taking a supplement that contained stinging nettle extract significantly reduced arthritis pain. Additionally, participants felt they could reduce their dose of anti-inflammatory pain relievers because of this capsule.<br><br>
                      That said, research is insufficient to recommend stinging nettle as an anti-inflammatory treatment. More human studies are needed.
                    </p>

                      3. May Treat Enlarged Prostate Symptoms
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Up to 50% of men aged 51 and older have an enlarged prostate gland.<br><br>
                      An enlarged prostate is commonly called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Scientists aren’t sure what causes BPH, but it can lead to significant discomfort during urination.<br><br>
                      Interestingly, a few studies suggest that stinging nettle may help treat BPH.<br><br>
                      Animal research reveals that this powerful plant may prevent the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone — a more powerful form of testosterone.<br><br>
                      Studies in people with BPH demonstrate that stinging nettle extracts help treat short- and long-term urination problems — without side effects.<br><br>
                      However, it’s unclear how effective stinging nettle is compared to conventional treatments.
                    </p>

                      4. May Treat Hay Fever
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hay fever is an allergy that involves inflammation in the lining of your nose.<br><br>
                      Stinging nettle is viewed as a promising natural treatment for hay fever.<br><br>
                      Test-tube research shows that stinging nettle extracts can inhibit inflammation that can trigger seasonal allergies.<br><br>
                      This includes blocking histamine receptors and stopping immune cells from releasing chemicals that trigger allergy symptoms.<br><br>
                      However, human studies note that stinging nettle is equal to or only slightly better at treating hay fever than a placebo.<br><br>
                      While this plant may prove a promising natural remedy for hay fever symptoms, more long-term human studies are needed.
                    </p>

                      5. May Lower Blood Pressure
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Approximately one in three American adults has high blood pressure.<br><br>
                      High blood pressure is a serious health concern because it puts you at risk of heart disease and strokes, which are among the leading causes of death worldwide.<br><br>
                      Stinging nettle was traditionally used to treat high blood pressure.<br><br>
                      Animal and test-tube studies illustrate that it may help lower blood pressure in several ways.<br><br>
                      For one, it may stimulate nitric oxide production, which acts as a vasodilator. Vasodilators relax the muscles of your blood vessels, helping them widen.<br><br>
                      In addition, stinging nettle has compounds that may act as calcium channel blockers, which relax your heart by reducing the force of contractions.<br><br>
                      In animal studies, stinging nettle has been shown to lower blood pressure levels while raising the heart’s antioxidant defenses.<br><br>However, stinging nettle’s effects on blood pressure in humans are still unclear. Additional human studies are needed before recommendations can be made.
                    </p>

                      6. May Aid Blood Sugar Control
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Both human and animal studies link stinging nettle to lower blood sugar levels.<br><br>
                      In fact, this plant contains compounds that may mimic the effects of insulin.<br><br>
                      In a three-month study in 46 people, taking 500 mg of stinging nettle extract three times daily significantly lowered blood sugar levels compared to a placebo.<br><br>
                      Despite promising findings, there are still far too few human studies on stinging nettle and blood sugar control. More research is necessary.

                    <h2 class="mb-3">Other Potential Benefits</h2>
                    <p>
                      Stinging nettle may offer other potential health benefits, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-detail py-3">

                        Reduced bleeding: Medicines
                        containing stinging nettle extract have been found to reduce excessive
                        bleeding, especially after surgery.
                      </span></li>

                        Liver health: Nettle’s
                        antioxidant properties may protect your liver against damage by toxins, heavy
                        metals and inflammation.

                        Natural diuretic: This plant may
                        help your body shed excess salt and water, which in turn
                        could lower blood pressure temporarily. Keep in mind that these findings
                        are from animal studies
                      </span></li>

                      <li><span>
                        Wound and burn healing: Applying
                        stinging nettle creams may support wound healing, including burn wounds
                      </span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">Potential Side Effects</h2>
                    <p>
                      Consuming dried or cooked stinging nettle is generally safe. There are few, if any, side effects.<br><br>
                      However, be careful when handling fresh stinging nettle leaves, as their hair-like barbs can harm your skin.<br><br>
                      These barbs can inject an array of chemicals, such as:
                    </p>

                        Leukotrienes
                      </span></li>

                      <li><span>
                        Formic
                        acid

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      These compounds can cause rashes, bumps, hives and itchiness.<br><br>
                      In rare cases, people may have a severe allergic reaction, which can be life-threatening.<br><br>
                      However, these chemicals diminish as the leaves are processed, meaning that you shouldn’t experience mouth or stomach irritation when eating dried or cooked stinging nettle.<br><br>
                      Pregnant women should avoid consuming stinging nettle because it may trigger uterine contractions, which can raise the risk of a miscarriage<br><br>
                      Speak to your doctor before consuming stinging nettle if you’re taking one of the following:

                    <p>
                      Stinging nettle could interact with these medications. For instance, the plant’s potential diuretic effect may strengthen the impact of diuretics, which can raise your risk of dehydration.
